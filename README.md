# odin-landing-page

## Description
Hi! This is the second project from TOP :D
In this project, we will be showcasing what we've learned so far with HTML and CSS!
We're making a landing page.

## Reflection
I think I got the job done, but the css is messy lol. I need to learn how to be organized and consistent with the... what so you call those? Basically, the Design System. Like in UX/UI Design. I'm curious how that could be done is CSS? Do you just keep a separate file where your design system is written?
Orrr can you add that in html/css and you know have keywords for it. ??? Theres more to learn. But I had fun doing this :)
